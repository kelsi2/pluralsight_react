# Reactful

- This process is similar to CRA but will create a bare-bones project with just what you need to get started, no extras installed
- Run npx reactful <project name>

* This is similar to what we did in fulljs but will include some extra commands to easily run components

  - npm start is a built in command that will run frontend and backend servers at localhost:1234

* Since this app is server-side rendered we get the error in the terminal rather than on the devTools, the dom will just say server error
